# SourceStats
A plugin originally called TF2Stats but then renamed to SourceStats and decided to support multiple games. This is an alternative to HLStats: CE and GameME (if not maybe better in some ways, idk)

Work in progress at the moment, pre-beta expected around mid april-may.

# Features:
Tracks kills. (Obviously)

Tons of commands to change how many points the player gets rewarded/subtracted and more.
(more to be added here since it's on early stages.

# Features yet to be added:
Achievements. (Earn achievements by doing the objective such as 25 headshots or 5 airshots, etc).
